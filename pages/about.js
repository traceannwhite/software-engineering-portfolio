        When I was an educator, I found myself doing all sorts of things to
        solve daily problems, even sometimes going so far as to fix problems
        that really didn’t need to be solved. My favorite part of the day was
        the planning period… those moments of silence, where I could just think
        and plan. I also found more creativity in my work and home life like
        making candles, painting, cooking, etc. As soon as I fell into software
        engineering it filled all those holes I was trying to create for myself
        in my work and home life.
